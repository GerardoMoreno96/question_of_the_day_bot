- Single Sign On (SSN): Log in with username and password to access multiple credentials. (SFDC, MS Office etc.)
- Directory Service: Managed Microsoft Active Directory. No need to migrate or replicate data to the cloud.
- Sagemaker: Machine Learning platform in AWS that lets you build, train and develop ML models for any use case with fully managed resources and tools.
- Rekognition: Pre-trained model to extract insights from your images and videos.
- Lookout: Use computer vision to detect defects on industrial products.
- Textract: Extract text from PDF, docs and images.
- Augmented AI: Provides human review workflows for common ML use cases. Means that a human will review the output before continuing.
- Comprehend: NLP service. Finds insights and relationships in text. Detects sentiments. Cannot read text from scanned documents.
- Lex: ML service used to develop chatbots (voice-based or text-based).
- Transcribe: Speech-to-text transcription service. Real-time transcription.
- Polly: Converts text into speech.
- Kendra: Intelligent search that looks into structured and unstructured data before sending the result.
- Personalize: Provides personalized recommendations based on their past activity and behavior.
- Translate: Real-time translation service.
- Forecast: Forecast a future outcome based on historical data. e.g: sales, web traffic, revenue, etc.
- Fraud detector: Automate fraud detection in your apps (e.g fake reviews, spam).
- Lookout for metrics: Detects anomalies in your business data such as rate drop in customers.
- DevOps Guru: Detects abnormal behavior in your app or resources.
- Code Guru: Provides intelligent recommendations for application performance, efficiency and code quality. Analyzes the performance of your apps.
- Code Whisperer: Automatically generates code and function in real-time, like GitHub copilot.
- Data Sync: Online data transfer service that automates the replication of data from on-premises to AWS.
- Transfer Family: Transfer files to S3 using FTP, SFTP & FTPS.
- Snowcone: Offline data transfer service. It's a physical device with 8TB of space. Transfers data with NFS mount.
- Snowball: Like snowcone but with 80TB of storage. Petabytes transfers.
- Snowmobile: Shipping container to transfer hexabytes data. Contains 100 petabytes of data.
- Application discovery service: Helps enterprise-plan customers plan migration projects. Discovers technical details of your app to migrate it to AWS.
- DMS: Migrate databases to AWS quickly. Supports Full load Data and Continues Data Changes.
- Server Migration Service (SMS): Migrate thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS. No need to install an agent like in Systems manager or Data Sync.
- Migration Hub: Single place to discover existing services, plan migrations and the status of each migration. It doesn't execute the migration. Only shows the status.
- Migration Evaluator: Best case to plan the migration. Recommends future state recommendations.
- Kinesis: Analyze and send data to streams in real-time. The different types are Data Streams, Firehose, Videostream and Data analytics.
- Kinesis Data Streams: Real-time data streaming service that captures gigabytes of data per second. Use cases: real-time apps, Website clickstreams, Online marketplaces.
- Kinesis data streams are usually the answer for then you want to process data in real time while maintaining the order
- Kinesis data streams is better to use than SQS when you have to process real-time data, when you have to maintain the order of the records, and whenever you need better speed and throughput
- Kinesis Firehose: Transforms and loads your streaming data into data sotres and anaylitcs tools. Like S3, Redshift, elasticsearch, etc
- Kinesis Firehose doesn't need to configure an external consumer like kinesis data stream. It is reccommended to use when you have to parse the data or remove sensitive data
- Kinesis Videostream: Streams videos from connected devices or sources to AWS. Used in data analytics, machine learning and video playback
- Kinesis Data Analytics: Serverless service to analyze and respond to your data in real time. It uses apache flink
