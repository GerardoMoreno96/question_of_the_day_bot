### **Databases:**
- The different relational databases in AWS are: RDS, Aurora, and Redshift.
- Amazon RDS is a relational database service that supports MySQL, Postgres, etc.
- Amazon Aurora is a fully managed service that's better than RDS. It automatically grows or scales as needed. It uses a database cluster. Use cases: online transaction apps.
- Redshift is a fully managed warehouse solution. Use cases: online analytical processing apps, data reporting, and analytics.
- Some non-relational DBs are DynamoDB, DocumentDB.
- DynamoDB stores data in an item-attributes structure.
- DocumentDB is a MongoDB compatible DB that stores JSON docs. A table is a collection, a row is called a document, and a column a field.
- Elasticache is an open-source in-memory database like Memcached & Redis. It is faster than disk databases. Use cases: real-time analytics, distributed session management, geospatial services.
- Memcached database does not have a data replication feature unlike Redis.
- AWS Keyspaces is an Apache Cassandra wide column database that can handle large amounts of data.
- AWS Neptune is a graph database service for apps that need access to many datasets.
- AWS Timestream is a serverless time series database for IoT and operational apps. Use cases: stock prices, weather changes.
- AWS Ledger is an immutable transaction log database that tracks each application data change.
